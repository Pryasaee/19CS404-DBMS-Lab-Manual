# Experiment 10: PL/SQL â€“ Triggers

## AIM
To write and execute PL/SQL trigger programs for automating actions in response to specific table events like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

---

## THEORY

A **trigger** is a stored PL/SQL block that is automatically executed or fired when a specified event occurs on a table or view. Triggers can be used for enforcing business rules, auditing changes, or automatic updates.

### Types of Triggers:
- **Before Trigger**: Executes before the operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **After Trigger**: Executes after the operation.
- **Row-level Trigger**: Executes for each affected row.
- **Statement-level Trigger**: Executes once for the triggering statement.

**Basic Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE|AFTER INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
   -- trigger logic
END;
```

## 1. Write a trigger to log every insertion into a table.
**Steps:**
- Create two tables: `employees` (for storing data) and `employee_log` (for logging the inserts).
- Write an **AFTER INSERT** trigger on the `employees` table to log the new data into the `employee_log` table.

PL/SQL query
```
create table employees11(
 employee_id INT primary key,
 first_name VARCHAR(50),
 dept_no INT,
 salary DECIMAL(10,2)
 );
 create table employee_log(
   log_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
   employee_id INT,
   first_name VARCHAR(50),
   dept_no INT,
   salary DECIMAL(10,2),
   log_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   DELIMITER $$
   create trigger trg_log_employee_insert
   AFTER INSERT ON employees11
   FOR EACH ROW
   BEGIN
      Insert into employee_log(employee_id,first_name,dept_no,salary)
      values(New.employee_id,new.first_name,new.dept_no,new.salary);
  END$$
  DELIMITER ;
  INSERT INTO employees11(employee_id,first_name,dept_no,salary)
  values(1,'Alice',10,5000.00);
  select * from employee_log;
```


**Expected Output:**
- A new entry is added to the `employee_log` table each time a new record is inserted into the `employees` table.

## 2. Write a trigger to prevent deletion of records from a sensitive table.
**Steps:**
- Write a **BEFORE DELETE** trigger on the `sensitive_data` table.
- Use `RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR` to prevent deletion and issue a custom error message.

PL/SQL query
```
create table sensitive_data(
  record_id INT primary key,
  info varchar(50)
  );
  DELIMITER $$
  create trigger trg_prevent_delete_sensitive
  BEFORE delete on sensitive_data
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
    SET MESSAGE_TExT = 'ERROR:DELETION not allowed in this table';
```

**Expected Output:**
- If an attempt is made to delete a record from `sensitive_data`, an error message is raised, e.g., `ERROR: Deletion not allowed on this table.`

Output:

## 3. Write a trigger to automatically update a `last_modified` timestamp.
**Steps:**
- Add a `last_modified` column to the `products` table.
- Write a **BEFORE UPDATE** trigger on the `products` table to set the `last_modified` column to the current timestamp whenever an update occurs.

PL/SQL query
```
CREATE TABLE customer_orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_name VARCHAR(100),
order_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
update_count INT DEFAULT 0
);
INSERT INTO audit_log (id, update_count) VALUES (1,0);
DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER trg_track_updates
AFTER UPDATE ON customer_orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
UPDATE audit_log
SET update_count = update_count + 1
WHERE id = 1;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
INSERT INTO customer_orders(order_id,customer_name,order_amount)
values(100,'Doe',150.00);
UPDATE customer_orders
SET order_amount = 200.00
WHERE order_id = 100;
UPDATE customer_orders
SET order_amount = 400.00
WHERE order_id = 100;
SELECT * FROM audit_log;
```

**Expected Output:**
- The `last_modified` column in the `products` table is updated automatically to the current date and time when any record is updated.

Output:

## 4. Write a trigger to keep track of the number of updates made to a table.
**Steps:**
- Create an `audit_log` table with a counter column.
- Write an **AFTER UPDATE** trigger on the `customer_orders` table to increment the counter in the `audit_log` table every time a record is updated.

PL/SQL query
```
CREATE TABLE customer_orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_name VARCHAR(100),
order_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
update_count INT DEFAULT 0
);
INSERT INTO audit_log (id, update_count) VALUES (1,0);
DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER trg_track_updates
AFTER UPDATE ON customer_orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
UPDATE audit_log
SET update_count = update_count + 1
WHERE id = 1;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
INSERT INTO customer_orders(order_id,customer_name,order_amount)
values(100,'Doe',150.00);
UPDATE customer_orders
SET order_amount = 200.00
WHERE order_id = 100;
UPDATE customer_orders
SET order_amount = 400.00
WHERE order_id = 100;
SELECT * FROM audit_log;
```


**Expected Output:**
- The `audit_log` table will maintain a count of how many updates have been made to the `customer_orders` table.

Output:

## 5. Write a trigger that checks a condition before allowing insertion into a table.
**Steps:**
- Write a **BEFORE INSERT** trigger on the `employees` table to check if the inserted salary meets a specific condition (e.g., salary must be greater than 3000).
- If the condition is not met, raise an error to prevent the insert.

PL/SQL query
```
DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER trg_check_salary_before_insert
Before insert ON employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
if NEW.salary<3000 then
Signal SQLSTATE '45000'
SET MESSAGE_TEXT= 'ERROR:Salary below minimum threshold.';
END IF;
END$$
DELIMITER ; 

INSERT INTO employee(employee_id,first_name,salary)
values(100,'Doe',250.00);
```

**Expected Output:**
- If the inserted salary in the `employees` table is below the condition (e.g., salary < 3000), the insert operation is blocked, and an error message is raised, such as: `ERROR: Salary below minimum threshold.`

Output:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df02d8bf-07eb-405f-a267-94e231205bf3)


## RESULT
Thus, the PL/SQL trigger programs were written and executed successfully.
